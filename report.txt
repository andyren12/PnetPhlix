I believe I finished all parts of the project and there aren't any 
apparent bugs or banned STL components.

I tested my UserDatabase and User classes by loading a userdatabase using the given users.txt file, and then calling get_user_from_email with various emails found in the txt file. To test if I was getting the right user, I would call User's get_full_name(), get_email(), and get_watch_history() functions and compare them against the information found in the database.

I tested my MovieDatabase and Movie classes by loading a smaller moviedatabase that I created where I could better see all the movies that had a certain actor, director, or genre. I called each of MovieDatabases's get_movies functions and manually checked to see if it correctly got each movie associated with a director, actor, or genre. I would then call each of a movie's getter functions to ensure all the information of the movie was stored correctly.

I tested my Recommender class again using my smaller moviedatabase, where I manually tallied scores for each movie based on directors, actors, and genres shared with a move I chose to test. I ran the recommend_movies function to test if compatibility scores generated by my code were the same as what I'd mathematically calculated and if tiebreakers were handled correctly. I tested different numbers of recommendations to see if my code produced the correct number of recommendations as well as what would happen if the number of recommendations asked for was greater than the number of movie that had a compatibility score greater than 1.
